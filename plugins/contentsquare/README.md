# Contentsquare MCP for Cursor

Query your Contentsquare analytics data directly from Cursor using natural language. Ask questions about user journeys, conversion funnels, error impact, and page performance without leaving your editor.

## Prerequisites

- A Contentsquare account with admin access
- Cursor IDE with MCP support enabled

## Installation

Install this plugin from the [Cursor marketplace](https://cursor.com/marketplace) by searching for **contentsquare**, or add it directly from this repository URL.

Once installed, Cursor will prompt you to authenticate with your Contentsquare account via OAuth. No manual token management required.

## Authentication

This plugin connects to the Contentsquare MCP server at `https://api.contentsquare.com/mcp` using OAuth 2.1 with PKCE. Cursor handles the authentication flow automatically when you first invoke a tool.

You will need:
- A Contentsquare account
- Admin-level access to at least one project
